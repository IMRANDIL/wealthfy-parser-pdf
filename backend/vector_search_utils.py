    Placeholder for vector database search.

    This function is a stub. In a real application, this would:
    1. Connect to a vector database (e.g., PostgreSQL with pgvector, Pinecone, etc.).
    2. Generate an embedding for the query_text.
    3. Perform a similarity search in the database.
    4. Return the top_k results.

    For now, it returns an empty list to allow the main application to run.
